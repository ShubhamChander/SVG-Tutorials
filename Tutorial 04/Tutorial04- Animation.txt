Animation has been used in web development for a long time. Needless to say, animations are also heavily used in svg. 

In SVGs, you can create animations using the animation tag <animation>, while specifying the type of animation being done. 

There are many types of animation such as, colours disappearing/appearing, objects moving across the screen, and shapes
change size or shapes. For each of these types of animations there are different animation tags. 
They include:
		<animate>
		<animateMotion>
		<animateTransform>
		<animateColour> (This tag is not being used anymore, as other animate tag can handle this simple task
of changing colour. But it is good to know. <animate> replaces this tag)

Take a look at some example code in the tutorial 04 files, namely,
	
	- animateEx.html
	- animateTransformEx.html 
	- animateMotionEx.html 

Problem 1)
	Create a path across the screen for an increasing sized circle and show that path, using <animateTransform>
	the circle. 

Problem 2)
	Open file Problem02.html and study the code. Afterwards, run the code on a browser and observe the animation in the <animateMotion>. Notice how it starts off moving
in a curved direction and then goes off screen. It is then reapears from the side of the screen. Try changing up some of the values in path, and observe the 
changes appear on the browser.
Bonus) Should you want, create another shape, and recreate the motion, however this time, add some event handling to it, such that
When the rectangle is clicked upon, it should begin.
