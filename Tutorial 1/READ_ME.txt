The first tutorial is to help with understanding the basics of SVGs(Scalable Vector Graphics)
This Tutorial will deal with the built-in shapes, unique custom made shapes, and texts

TO test, start server and go to localhost:3000

- default page should be a DEFAULT SVG PAGE

- localhost:3000/SVG_Drawing.html should be shapes. An example of how shapes are created in SVG

- localhost:3000/SVG_Texts.html should be texts. An example of how texts are created in SVG 


USED http://blogs.sitepointstatic.com/examples/tech/svg-curves/cubic-curve.html to create custom shapes. MENTION THAT IN TUTORIAL TOO


Maybe use http://tutorials.jenkov.com/svg/index.html for tutorial 1.5
