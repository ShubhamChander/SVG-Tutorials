SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics are basically another way to draw images. Using SVG, you can more easily draw images or shapes.
You can also store svg shapes into files. For more information refer to https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp


There are multiple ways you can create shapes. You can each use the general shape format tag or the custom made shape tag.
In the general shape format, you have to provide with the shape code with the information for the shape itself.

For example, for circle, you have to provide it with x and y coordinate and a radius value.
For rectangle, you have to provide it with x, y coordinate, width and height value. 

For custom made shape, you can create an outline of the shape using the path tag.
