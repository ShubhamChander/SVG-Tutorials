Like Mouse handling events in HTML 5, svg can also handle mouse event. 

Mouse Event handling events are defined as those events that are caused by the user somehow
interacting with the svg elements, mainly by the cursor. Events include either the mouse
clicking on the said element or just hovering over it. 

To handle simple mouse events, there are already "built-in handlers" such as onmouseleave, onmouseenter, onmousemove, that will trigger once the event occurs.

There are also simple functions such as setAttribute that will run once an event is triggered. 

For more complex changes, you can use Jacascript to create functions that will run once an event is triggered. 

Preliminary:

	Visit the mouseEventEx page and hover the mouse on the black circle. It shall disappear.
	When you remove your mouse from on top of the now invisible circle, it shall turn red. 
 
	Notice how it is hardly three lines of codes. 

	For a more exciting and slightly more complicated with more a slightly more complex code base, 
	move on to the wireLoop game page. 

	
	Like HTML5, you can pass in the mouse event and essentially manipulate the DOM model


Problem 1)
	Understand the BoxMove game, and change the game as follows:
	
	A) Change the game such that when black box detects the mouse,
	the red box moves

	B) Change the game such that when red box detects the mouse, the black box
	moves in only one direction, either x or y. 

Problem 2)
	Everytime a mouse moves, a shape disappears on screen. There are many ways you can complete this. You can either have shape elements already present that change
	colour, or you can set a shape shape on the browser page through the javascript function.
