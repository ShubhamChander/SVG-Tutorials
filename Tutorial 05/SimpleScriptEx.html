<!-- You can add a single or many event handler function to one svg element or multiple svg elements--> 

<!-- In this simple example, there are two types of event handler. A) when the page is loaded, the AddBox function is triggered
	B) When the mouse enters the black box, the detectMouse function is triggered.
	
	As you can see there are also multiple event handlers on a single svg element
 -->
